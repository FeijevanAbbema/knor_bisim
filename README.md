In this project you will find three files. 

Firstly in the folder src you will find knor.cpp. knor.cpp contains the source code for this project. You should be able to copy knor.cpp in the original repository of Tom van Dijk and run it for yourself.
Most of knor.cpp is copied from the original code. The newly added code is introduced by a block comment saying that this is added code (around lines 1500-1800 and line 2000)
Looper.sh automatically runs the bisimilation for every file in the examples folder.
bisim_min_data.csv contains the data that is gained from running looper.sh.
process_data.py contains a small script that processes bisim_min_data.csv and gives some data (which is used in the paper)
