In this project you will find three files. 

Firstly in the folder src you will find knor.cpp. knor.cpp contains the source code for this project. You should be able to copy knor.cpp in the original repository of Tom van Dijk and run it for yourself.
Looper.sh automatically runs the bisimilation for every file in the examples folder.
bisim_min_data.csv contains the data that is gained from running looper.sh.
